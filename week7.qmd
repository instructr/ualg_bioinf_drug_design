# Final Project Guidelines


**Format and Deadlines**

  * **Video submission:** A video of **2â€“5 minutes** must be uploaded to **Tutoria** by **17 October 2025**.
  * **In-class presentation:** Each group will present for **3 minutes**, followed by a **5-minute discussion**, on **20 and 21 October 2025**.


**Group Work**

  * The project must be completed in **groups of two students**.
  * Each **drug** can only be selected by **one group** (first come, first served).


**Content Requirements**

  * The work must integrate information from **at least five databases**, including:

    * **Mandatory:** [DrugBank](https://go.drugbank.com), [UniProt](https://www.uniprot.org), and [RCSB PDB](https://www.rcsb.org).
    * **Plus two additional databases** of your choice.
  
  * For drugs that have **multiple targets**, choose one that you find interesting and that also has a PDB entry. 
  If you are unsure which to select, use the **first protein target** (as listed in the *Targets* section of *DrugBank*) **that also appears in the RCSB PDB database**. This will be the protein you explore further in your study.



> Please note that some drug targets are not human proteins.


**List of Drugs**

  * Choose your **drug** for the project from the list provided below.
  * Use this shared file [**linked here**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LLLToOTOkrPdjUq_cv-61D0cDZz14UrYThknd_xo6U4/edit?usp=sharing) to make your selection.

# Evaluation criteria

### **Evaluation Criteria | Final Project**

To keep a **fair and balanced evaluation scheme**, we will include instructor and peer evaluation, rewarding *clarity*, *teamwork*, and *scientific rigor*.

The final project is graded out of **20 points**, combining **instructor evaluation (15 points)** and **peer evaluation (5 points)**.

> *All group members receive the same grade unless there is clear evidence of unequal contribution.*


#### **1. Instructor Evaluation (15 points total)**

| **Category**                                        | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                 | **Points** |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| **A. Scientific Content (6 pts)**                   | Accuracy and depth of information. Correct use of database resources (DrugBank, UniProt, PDB, +2 chosen). Demonstrates understanding of molecular mechanisms, targets, and therapeutic context. | 0â€“6        |
| **B. Integration of Databases (3 pts)**             | Effective combination of data from multiple sources. Proper referencing and data interpretation rather than simple copying.                                                                     | 0â€“3        |
| **C. Communication & Clarity (3 pts)**              | Clear, well-organized narrative in both video and oral presentation. Proper scientific terminology, logical flow, and engaging visuals.                                                         | 0â€“3        |
| **D. Team Collaboration & Professionalism (3 pts)** | Evidence of balanced contribution, time management, and adherence to submission deadlines.                                                                                                      | 0â€“3        |



#### **2. Peer Evaluation (5 points total)**

Each student will anonymously evaluate **two other groups** after the presentations, using the following criteria.
Average peer scores will contribute up to **5 points** to the groupâ€™s final mark.

| **Category**                           | **Description**                                                                  | **Points** |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| **A. Clarity of Presentation (2 pts)** | Was the presentation easy to follow and visually clear?                          |            |
| **B. Scientific Interest (2 pts)**     | Did the presentation make you learn or think about something new or interesting? |            |
| **C. Engagement (1 pt)**               | Did the presenters engage with the audience or respond well to questions?        |            |

*Peer evaluations will be normalized so that all groups are fairly assessed.*


#### **Final Grade Calculation**

| Source                | Weight   | Maximum Points |
| --------------------- | -------- | -------------- |
| Instructor evaluation | 75%      | 15             |
| Peer evaluation       | 25%      | 5              |
| **Total**             | **100%** | **20**         |
