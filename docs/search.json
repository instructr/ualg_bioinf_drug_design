Once given a database accession number, the data in primary databases are never changed: they form part of the scientific record.\nSecondary databases comprise data derived from the results of analysing primary data. They provide curated, processed, or interpreted data that is derived from the combination of diverse sources of primary data, offering functional insights and higher-level biological context, to derive new knowledge from the public record of science. Secondary databases have become the molecular biologistâ€™s reference library, offering extensive information on nearly every studied gene or gene product. Although often overwhelming, these resources hold enormous potential for discovery through data mining."

    "section": "5.2 Comparing",
    "text": "5.2 Comparing\nThe most frequently used type of comparison in bioinformatics is sequence comparison to help reveal relationships in function, evolution, or both. The most common approach is sequence comparison, where nucleotide or protein sequences are aligned to database entries. Alignments account for insertions, deletions, and substitutions that may have occurred since divergence from a common ancestor. Matches can suggest evolutionary or functional relationships.\nAlignments may be pairwise or multiple, with different tools suited to different contexts: for example, BLAST is designed for finding regions of local similarity between sequences across large databases with high sensitivity, while BLAT is optimized for quickly aligning nearly identical sequences to a reference genome with lower sensitivity but much greater speed.\n\nControls\nThe key challenge is judging whether an alignment is significant, not just producing it. Significance is measured by the expectation score (e-value): the lower the e-value, the less likely it is that the match is random, and therefore, the more likely it reflects true homology. Controls include comparing random sequences and checking scores for unrelated sequences. Tool choice also matters, as tools differ in speed, accuracy, and suitability for specific applications."

    "section": "5.3 Modelling",
    "text": "5.3 Modelling\nStructural modelling helps generate hypotheses about the 3D structure of macromolecules and their biochemical functions. A major breakthrough came with AlphaFold (Google DeepMind, 2021), which predicts protein structures from sequences. Its impact was recognised with the 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, awarded to Demis Hassabis, John M. Jumper, and David Baker. In collaboration with EMBL-EBI, AlphaFold predictions are freely available in the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database.\nAnother widely used option for structural modelling is SWISS-MODEL, a web-based service developed at the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics (SIB). It provides automated homology modelling of protein 3D structures by using known experimental structures as templates. This allows researchers to generate reliable structural models when experimental data are not available, making SWISS-MODEL a valuable complement to resources like AlphaFold.\n\nIn the Drug-Design module of this course, you will learn learn more about structural modelling.\n\nBeyond individual molecules, researchers also model biological processes and interactions (systems biology). Standardised mathematical models can be accessed from the BioModels Database. Systems modelling follows an iterative cycle:\n\nBuild a model based on current knowledge;\nTest it against biological data;\nRefine it;\nRepeat until the model reliably reflects reality."

    "text": "5.4 Integrating\nData integration has long been a challenge in bioinformatics, yet it is a powerful way to test hypotheses. By combining results, for example from transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, researchers can gather strong evidence for the involvement of a pathway in disease or drug resistance. Like systems modelling, integration supports hypothesis generation, but experimental validation remains essential.\nThe good news is that many resources now handle much of the complex work of linking and integrating data. One example is EBI Search, which maps related entities efficiently (also mentioned above in the Searching section).\nAnother is Open Targets, a platform that integrates large volumes of public data to support discovery. Open Targets is specifically designed to help researchers explore and visualise drug targets in the context of disease."
