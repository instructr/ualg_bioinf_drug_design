**TP Activity 5:**

**Exploring the Semaglutide Target - GLP1R in Ensembl**


#### **Goal**

  * **Explore** and **critically interpret bioinformatics resources** to connect semaglutideâ€™s drug target *GLP1R* gene with its gene features and annotations.

  * Use the following database:
  
    * [Ensembl](https://www.ensembl.org/index.html)


#### **How to work**

1. **Search for semaglutide** in [DrugBank](https://go.drugbank.com) and skim the drug overview.

2. In the drug page, go to the **Targets** section and open the **UniProt** entry for the human target (GLP1R). 

3. In UniProt, use the **External links** tab and find **Genome annotation databases**. Click the **Ensembl gene** link (the ID that begins with **ENSG**).

   > **About Ensembl IDs**\
   >
   > Ensembl identifiers start with **ENS**:\
   > â€¢ **ENSG** = gene (e.g., the GLP1R gene)\
   > â€¢ **ENST** = transcript\
   > â€¢ **ENSP** = protein\
   > â€¢ **ENSE** = exon\
   > â€¢ ...


4. In **Ensembl** (gene entry for **GLP1R**), answer:

   1. Where is the *GLP1R* gene located?
      - Chromosome, genomic coordinates, **genome assembly version**, and strand.

   2. How many **transcripts** are annotated for *GLP1R*, and what are their **Ensembl transcript IDs (ENST)**?
      - Identify the **canonical** and/or **MANE Select** transcript if shown.

   3. For the **longest protein-coding transcript**, how many **exons** and **introns** does it have?

   4. What are the **coordinates of all exons** for that transcript?

   5. What are the coordinates of the **5â€² UTR** and **3â€² UTR**?

   6. What are the coordinates of the **Transcription Start Site (TSS)** and the **start codon**?

      > Reminder: the start codon encodes **Methionine (ATG)**.
      > The **TSS** is the first transcribed base of the transcript and may be **upstream** of the start codon.

   7. What is the **total gene length** in base pairs (bp)?

   8. How would you compute the **total Coding Sequence (CDS) length**?

      > Remember: `feature length = end âˆ’ start + 1`.\
      >
      > Tip: Ensembl coordinates are **1-based, inclusive**; always confirm the strand.
