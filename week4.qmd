# Theory

### Introduction

This class explores two important clinical genetics databases: **ClinVar** and **OMIM**.

ClinVar collects and shares information about the **clinical significance of genetic variants**, while OMIM is a comprehensive catalogue of **human genes and genetic disorders**.

Together, they help connect **specific variants** with **disease descriptions**, providing complementary views on medical genetics.

### Challenges

* **Complex terminology:** clinical significance terms (e.g., *pathogenic*, *likely benign*) and disease inheritance patterns may be unfamiliar.
* **Variant mapping:** linking a genetic variant in ClinVar to the correct OMIM disease entry can be confusing.
* **Evidence levels:** ClinVar entries vary in strength (single submission vs expert panel review).
* **Cross-references:** many links lead to other resources (NCBI Gene, UniProt, PubMed), requiring careful navigation.

> Itâ€™s normal to feel uncertain at first. With practice, you will learn how to interpret the classification systems and follow cross-links effectively.

### Databases overview

<br>  

#### **ClinVar**

![ClinVar home page.](figs/clinvar.png)

**URL:** [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar)

**1. Purpose |** Archive of reported **genetic variants** and their **clinical significance** for human health.

**2. Content |** Variant identifiers, genomic coordinates, clinical classification (pathogenic â†’ benign), associated conditions, evidence levels, submitter details, and supporting references.

**3. Typical Use Cases**

* Look up whether a specific variant has been linked to disease.
* Compare classifications across submitters.
* Find references and links to PubMed, Gene, and OMIM.

**4. External Connections |** Cross-linked with **OMIM** (disease descriptions), **NCBI Gene/RefSeq**, **dbSNP**, **UniProt**, and PubMed.

<br>  

#### **OMIM â€“ Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man**

![OMIM home page.](figs/omim.png)

**URL:** [https://www.omim.org](https://www.omim.org)

**1. Purpose |** Authoritative catalogue of **human genes and genetic disorders**, with curated descriptions of phenotypes and inheritance patterns.

**2. Content |** Geneâ€“disease associations, inheritance modes (dominant, recessive, etc.), clinical synopses, phenotype series, references, and historical notes.

**3. Typical Use Cases**

* Find detailed descriptions of diseases linked to a gene.
* Understand inheritance patterns and clinical features.
* Explore curated references to key publications.

**4. External Connections |** Linked with **ClinVar** (variants), **NCBI Gene**, **UniProt**, **PubMed**, and pathway resources such as **KEGG** and **Reactome**.


# Practical

**TP Activity 4**

**Imatinib & Chromosomal Fusions**

#### **Goal**

* **Explore** and **critically interpret bioinformatics resources** to connect imatinibâ€™s drug target(s) with its genetic variants, clinical relevance, and disease associations.
* Use the following two databases:

  * [ClinVar](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/)
  * [OMIM](https://www.omim.org/)

#### **How to work**

1. **Search for imatinib** in [DrugBank](https://go.drugbank.com).
2. In the *Indications* section, identify the diseases or conditions treated with imatinib. Search these conditions in **OMIM** to explore geneâ€“disease relationships, inheritance patterns, and clinical summaries relevant to imatinibâ€™s targets.
3. Return to the DrugBank entry and follow the links to the **gene(s)** associated with imatinibâ€™s molecular targets. Use the **NCBI Gene ID** link to access detailed information about these targets.
4. In **NCBI Gene**, navigate to the *Variation* section and selected some variant links to **ClinVar**.
5. In **ClinVar**, explore the gene entries to review reported variants, their clinical significance, and associated conditions.


#### **Evaluation**

* Select **4 facts from each database (ClinVar and OMIM)** that were **surprising** or new to you.
* For each fact, briefly explain **why** it was surprising or new.
* Write your findings in a Word document and submit it in the **Tutoria** before the end of class.
