# Theory

### Introduction

This class explores two important clinical genetics databases: **ClinVar** and **OMIM**.

ClinVar collects and shares information about the **clinical significance of genetic variants**, while OMIM is a comprehensive catalogue of **human genes and genetic disorders**.

Together, they help connect **specific variants** with **disease descriptions**, providing complementary views on medical genetics.

### Challenges

* **Complex terminology:** clinical significance terms (e.g., *pathogenic*, *likely benign*) and disease inheritance patterns may be unfamiliar.
* **Variant mapping:** linking a genetic variant in ClinVar to the correct OMIM disease entry can be confusing.
* **Evidence levels:** ClinVar entries vary in strength (single submission vs expert panel review).
* **Cross-references:** many links lead to other resources (NCBI Gene, UniProt, PubMed), requiring careful navigation.

> It’s normal to feel uncertain at first. With practice, you will learn how to interpret the classification systems and follow cross-links effectively.

### Databases overview

<br>  

#### **ClinVar**

![ClinVar home page.](figs/clinvar.png)

**URL:** [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar)

**1. Purpose |** Archive of reported **genetic variants** and their **clinical significance** for human health.

**2. Content |** Variant identifiers, genomic coordinates, clinical classification (pathogenic → benign), associated conditions, evidence levels, submitter details, and supporting references.

**3. Typical Use Cases**

* Look up whether a specific variant has been linked to disease.
* Compare classifications across submitters.
* Find references and links to PubMed, Gene, and OMIM.

**4. External Connections |** Cross-linked with **OMIM** (disease descriptions), **NCBI Gene/RefSeq**, **dbSNP**, **UniProt**, and PubMed.

<br>  

#### **OMIM – Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man**

![OMIM home page.](figs/omim.png)

**URL:** [https://www.omim.org](https://www.omim.org)

**1. Purpose |** Authoritative catalogue of **human genes and genetic disorders**, with curated descriptions of phenotypes and inheritance patterns.

**2. Content |** Gene–disease associations, inheritance modes (dominant, recessive, etc.), clinical synopses, phenotype series, references, and historical notes.

**3. Typical Use Cases**

* Find detailed descriptions of diseases linked to a gene.
* Understand inheritance patterns and clinical features.
* Explore curated references to key publications.

**4. External Connections |** Linked with **ClinVar** (variants), **NCBI Gene**, **UniProt**, **PubMed**, and pathway resources such as **KEGG** and **Reactome**.


# Practical

**TP Activity 4**

**Imatinib & Chromosomal Fusions**

#### **Goal**

* **Explore** and **critically interpret bioinformatics resources** to connect imatinib’s drug target(s) with its genetic variants, clinical relevance, and disease associations.
* Use the following two databases:

  * [ClinVar](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/)
  * [OMIM](https://www.omim.org/)


#### **How to work**

1. **Search for imatinib** in [DrugBank](https://go.drugbank.com). Briefly review the drug overview.

2. Navigate to the *Pharmacology -> Indication* section and identify the **diseases or conditions treated with imatinib**. Then, go to OMIM and search for **chronic myeloid leukemia**. Explore the gene–disease relationships, inheritance patterns, and clinical summaries relevant to imatinib’s targets.

3. In **OMIM**, explore the **Gene/Locus MIM number** for both the **BCR and ABL1 genes** (links are in the **Phenotype–Gene Relationships** table at the top).

4. On the MIM page for each gene, find the **Variation** section under **External links** in the table on the right. **Choose one gene and click the ClinVar link.**

5. In **ClinVar**, you will find all reported variants for your chosen gene, their clinical significance, and associated conditions. Filter the variants by one type of **Germline classification** and one type of **Molecular consequence** that you find most interesting. Explore these in detail.


#### **Notes | About clinical genetics terminology**

**1. How to read genetic coordinates (chromosomal locations)**

* The notation **`9q34.12`** is the cytogenetic band that describes a location on a chromosome. Here’s how to read it step by step:

  * **9** -> Chromosome number. This gene or variant is on chromosome 9.
  * **q** -> Arm of the chromosome.

    * **p** = short arm (*petit*)
    * **q** = long arm
    * So this is on the **long arm of chromosome 9**.
  * **34.12** -> Band, sub-band, and sub-sub-band number, based on the standard G-banding pattern seen under a microscope.

    * **3** -> Region (counted from the centromere outward)
    * **4** -> Band within region 3
    * **.1** -> Sub-band 1
    * **2** -> Sub-sub-band 2


**2. How to read and interpret *variant notation*, using the example `c.763G>A`**.

- **Prefix (`c.`)**

  * **`c.`** = **coding DNA reference sequence**.
  This indicates that the numbering is relative to the coding DNA sequence (CDS) of a reference transcript.
  Other common prefixes:

    * **g.** = genomic sequence (genome coordinates)
    * **m.** = mitochondrial DNA sequence
    * **n.** = non-coding DNA reference sequence
    * **r.** = RNA sequence
    * **p.** = protein sequence


- **Position (`763`)**

  * **763** = the nucleotide position within the coding sequence (CDS), counting from the **start codon (ATG)** as position 1.
  * This means the variant affects the **763rd nucleotide** in the coding sequence.


- **Reference Base (`G`)**

  * **G** = the **reference (wild-type) nucleotide** at this position.
  * This is what is expected in the reference transcript.

- **Variant Base (`A`)**

  * **A** = the **alternate (mutant) nucleotide** that replaces the reference base.
  * In this case, **G is substituted by A**.


- **Type of Variant**

  * **Substitution**: one base has been changed to another.
  * Full interpretation: **“At coding DNA position 763, guanine (G) is replaced by adenine (A).”**


* Examples of Other Notations

  * **`c.763delG`** → Deletion of G at position 763
  * **`c.763_764insA`** → Insertion of A between positions 763 and 764
  * **`c.763_765del`** → Deletion of bases 763 to 765
  * **`c.763+1G>T`** → Substitution at the first base of the **splice donor site** (one base after coding position 763, i.e., in the intron)
  * **`p.Gly255Asp`** → Protein-level change (glycine at codon 255 replaced by aspartic acid)


**3. Advice | How to quickly learn about unknown or forgotten terminology?**

  * Example: Do you know what **GRCh38/hg38** means? It is the version of the human genome assembly.
  
    * To learn more, please ask [Perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai/) the following question: **"Explain briefly the meaning of GRCh38/hg38 in the context of genomics."**
  
  * Keep doing the same (using Perplexity or another search engine of your choice) whenever you come across terminology that is unfamiliar to you, or that you would like a quick recap on.

> **Reminder:** These classes are about learning to explore large information resources and making the most of them.


#### **Evaluation**

* Select **4 facts from each database (ClinVar and OMIM)** that were **surprising** or new to you.
* For each fact, briefly explain **why** it was surprising or new.
* Write your findings in a Word document and submit it in the **Tutoria** before the end of class.
