## Course Overview

This 7-week module introduces bioinformatics concepts and tools relevant for pharmaceutical sciences. Students will gain hands-on experience with public databases and online tools to retrieve, analyse, and interpret genomic, proteomic, and transcriptomic data.

**Format**:  

- Weekly: 1-hour theory class + 1.5-hour practical class (repeated for 2 student groups).
- Each week focuses on one theme, covered in both theory and practical sessions.


**Target audience**: Pharmacy students with basic knowledge in molecular biology and genetics.

**Assessment**:

- Final short video report: characterisation of a gene/protein using bioinformatics tools.
  - 2-5 minutes;
  - Groups of 2 students;
  - Final presentation and discussion of the video report.
  

## TP Classes Overview

#### **Goal**

Learn to independently explore and critically interpret bioinformatics resources in order to connect drugs with their molecular targets and understand their pharmacological, mechanistic, and clinical relevance.

#### **Learning outcomes**

By the end of the TP practical classes, students should be able to:

-   Identify the molecular target(s) of a given drug using authoritative online bioinformatics resources.

-   Retrieve and interpret relevant information on drug classes, mechanisms of action, target function, pathways, and clinical associations.

-   Integrate data from multiple sources to explain the pharmacological and clinical importance of a drug–target pair.

-   Demonstrate independent inquiry skills by selecting appropriate databases, justifying search strategies, and reflecting on findings.

-   Communicate discoveries clearly through concise answers, group discussions, and structured information reporting.

#### **Evaluation**

Any student choosing to complete the worksheet and take part in the class discussion, will earn one bonus point toward the final grade for the bioinformatics module evaluation (the video + presentation report).

Their participation in class will be evaluated using these criteria:

-   **Complete answers** → Did you cover everything that was asked?
-   **Smart searching** → Did you find the info in a clear and simple way?
-   **Double-checking** → Did you confirm the info by looking at more than one place?
-   **Sharing** → Are you ready to explain to the class how you found your answers?

#### **Activities general overview** 

Starting from a **drug**, the students will be guided on the journey to discover its **molecular target**, priming them to explore online resources in order to uncover information that is central to pharmaceutical sciences students.

1.  Every activity will follow the same **conceptual map**:

Drug ➝ Target ➝ Mechanism ➝ Structure ➝ Pathway ➝ Clinical impact

2.  The **categories of information** that students should be able to find online and articulate for each drug–target pair are:

-   **A. Drug Basics**
    -   Therapeutic category
    -   Mechanism of action
    -   Therapeutic indications
    -   Adverse effects
-   **B. Target Identity**
    -   Gene name and synonyms
    -   Protein function
    -   Tissue expression
    -   Pathophysiological relevance
-   **C. Molecular Mechanism**
    -   Binding site
    -   Structural information
    -   Known mutations
    -   Pathway involvement
-   **D. Clinical and Translational Relevance**
    -   Drug resistance mechanisms
    -   Drug–drug interactions
    -   Biomarkers of response
    -   Approved vs experimental uses

3.  Most relevant databases for each category of relevant information to retrieve for each drug-target pair are (as a general rule):

-   *Drug bank*, (*ChEMBL*, *PubChem*) = drug details
-   *UniProt* = protein details
-   *NCBI/Ensembl/UCSC* = gene identity & functional details
-   *PDB* = structure
-   *ClinVar/OMIM* = clinical genetics & variants
-   *KEGG/Reactome* = pathways
