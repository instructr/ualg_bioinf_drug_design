# Theory

### Introduction

This class explores two important yet very different databases: **DrugBank** and **NCBI**. 

DrugBank focuses on drugs, their molecular targets, and clinical information, while NCBI is a broad platform that integrates many types of biological data, from genes and proteins to literature and clinical variants. 

Together, they show how specialised and general-purpose resources can complement each other, and why learning to navigate both is essential for connecting drug information with the underlying biology.

### Challenges

Using these large online resources for the first time presents some challenges and common difficulties: 

- **Information overload:** both DrugBank and NCBI contain a lot of data and links; you may feel lost in deciding what is essential versus background.

- **Navigation structure:** NCBI in particular is a collection of many sub-databases (Gene, PubMed, ClinVar, GEO, etc.), and you may not immediately know which one to enter or how to move between them.

- **Technical terminology:** drug mechanisms, gene names, and clinical annotations use specialised vocabulary that may not yet be familiar to you.

- **Cross-referencing:** following links across databases (e.g., from DrugBank to UniProt, or from NCBI Gene to PubMed articles) can feel like “falling down a rabbit hole” without a clear strategy.

- **Search skills:** knowing what search terms to use (drug name, gene symbol, disease, accession number) and how to refine results can be challenging at the start.

> It’s normal to feel a bit overwhelmed when using any online Bioinformatics resource for the first time. These databases are large and detailed, and **nobody masters them right away**. With practice, the structure becomes more familiar, and you will quickly learn how to find the information you need. **Don’t worry if it feels slow at the beginning** - every search builds your confidence, and over time the process becomes natural. By the end of these classes you will feel confident finding your way around key bioinformatics databases.

### Databases overview

<br>

#### **DrugBank**

![Drugbank home page.](figs/drugbank.png)

**URL:** [https://go.drugbank.com](https://go.drugbank.com)

**1. Purpose | ** A resource that combines detailed information on drugs with their molecular targets and mechanisms of action.

**2. Content | ** Includes approved and experimental drugs, chemical structures, pharmacological data, molecular targets (genes/proteins), pathways, interactions, and related clinical information.

**3. Typical Use Cases**

* Identify the molecular target of a drug (e.g., which enzyme or receptor it binds).
* Explore known drug–drug interactions.
* Check clinical indications and side effects.
* Find links between drugs and genetic information.

**4. External Connections | ** Cross-linked with many complementary resources such as UniProt (proteins), KEGG (pathways), PubChem/ChEMBL (chemical compounds), and NCBI (gene information), SMPDB (small molecule pathways), among others.

#### **NCBI - National Center for Biotechnology Information**

![NCBI home page.](figs/ncbi.png)
**URL:** [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov)

**1. Purpose | ** A central hub providing access to a wide range of biological and biomedical databases and tools, covering genes, genomes, proteins, literature, and clinical information.

**2. Content | ** Includes PubMed (scientific literature), Gene (gene information), Nucleotide and Protein sequence databases, ClinVar (clinical variants), dbSNP (genetic variation), GEO (expression data), and many others.

**3. Typical Use Cases**

* Search for scientific articles on a drug, gene, or disease.
* Look up detailed information about a specific gene or protein.
* Explore genetic variants and their clinical significance.
* Access genomic and transcriptomic datasets for analysis.

**4. External Connections | ** Cross-linked with numerous resources such as UniProt (proteins), OMIM (diseases), KEGG/Reactome (pathways), RCSB PDB (structures), and DrugBank (drugs and targets), among many others.


### Class Live Demonstration

In this session, we will begin with a live demonstration of one drug entry: **either suggested by the class or chosen by the instructor** (for example, metformin), to show the main features and how to navigate these two databases.


# Practical

### **TP Activity 2**

**Ibuprofen & Prostaglandin Pathways**

**Goal:**

* Learn how to **explore** and **critically interpret bioinformatics resources** by connecting **Ibuprofen** with its molecular targets.
* Understand its **pharmacological action**, **mechanism of action**, and **clinical relevance**.
* Use the following databases: [DrugBank](https://go.drugbank.com), [NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov).

**How to work:**

1. **Search for Ibuprofen** in [DrugBank](https://go.drugbank.com).
2. **Review the DrugBank entry** and use it to answer the worksheet questions.

   * Support each answer with a **reference (link, screenshot, or citation)** so it can be verified.
3. **Tip:** DrugBank links to many other databases with complementary information about targets, diseases, pathways, and genetic details. Be pragmatic: choose the linked resources most useful for answering the worksheet.

4. Below you can view the worksheet. To complete it, please use the template file provided in the class's [Tutoria eletrónica](https://tutoria.ualg.pt/2025).
