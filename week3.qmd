# Theory

### Introduction

This class explores two complementary databases: **UniProt** and **RCSB PDB**.

UniProt focuses on proteinsâ€”their sequences, functions, domains, isoforms, variants, and biological context, while RCSB PDB is the central archive of experimentally determined **3D macromolecular structures** and related ligands.

Together, they show how sequence-level knowledge and structure-level evidence combine to explain protein function and drug interactions. Learning to navigate both is essential for connecting **what a protein is** (UniProt) with **how it looks and works in 3D** (PDB).

### Challenges

Using these resources for the first time presents common difficulties:

* **Information overload:** both UniProt and PDB are rich and dense; it takes practice to identify what is essential for your question.
* **Identifier mapping:** connecting a **UniProt accession** to the correct **PDB structure(s)** can be tricky (isoforms, chain IDs, residue numbering).
* **Quality and interpretation:** structures vary by **method** (X-ray, cryo-EM, NMR), **resolution**, and **completeness**; understanding validation metrics is important.
* **Navigation structure:** UniProt integrates many cross-references (InterPro, Pfam, Reactome, KEGG, etc.); PDB integrates tools, visualisers, and related databases (EMDB, PDBe-KB).
* **Technical terminology:** domains, motifs, PTMs, variants, assemblies, interfaces, and binding sites may be unfamiliar at first.
* **Search skills:** choosing effective queries (gene symbol vs UniProt accession; PDB ID vs ligand name) and refining filters is key.

> As always: Itâ€™s normal to feel a bit overwhelmed at the start. These databases are extensive, and **nobody masters them immediately**. With practice, their structure becomes familiar and you will quickly find what you need. **Do not worry if it feels slow initially**â€”each search builds confidence, and over time the process becomes natural. By the end of these classes you will feel confident navigating core protein and structure databases.

### Databases overview

<br>

#### **UniProt**

![UniProt home page.](figs/uniprot.png)

**URL:** [https://www.uniprot.org](https://www.uniprot.org)

**1. Purpose |** A comprehensive knowledgebase of protein **sequences** and **functional annotations**.

**2. Content |** Protein names, gene symbols, isoforms, domains/motifs, post-translational modifications (PTMs), subcellular localisation, interaction partners, variants/disease associations, pathways, cross-references, and evidence codes.

**3. Typical Use Cases**

* Retrieve a **canonical protein sequence** and known **isoforms**.
* Identify **functional domains/motifs** and **PTMs** relevant to activity or regulation.
* Review **variants** (position, effect, disease links) and map them to the sequence.
* Find **pathway context** (via Reactome/KEGG) and **proteinâ€“protein interactions**.
* Jump to **3D structures** and structure coverage via cross-links to PDB.

**4. External Connections |** Cross-linked with **RCSB PDB** (structures), **NCBI**, **Ensembl**, **InterPro** (domains), **Reactome/KEGG** (pathways), **ClinVar/OMIM** (clinical), **ChEMBL/DrugBank** (bioactive compounds/targets), among others.

<br>

#### **RCSB PDB â€“ Protein Data Bank**

![RCSB PDB home page.](figs/pdb.png)

**URL:** [https://www.rcsb.org](https://www.rcsb.org)

**1. Purpose |** The primary public archive of **experimentally determined 3D structures** of proteins, nucleic acids, and complexes, with tools for visualisation and analysis.

**2. Content |** Atomic coordinates, experimental method (X-ray, cryo-EM, NMR), resolution/validation metrics, **biological assemblies**, ligands/cofactors, binding sites, sequence-to-structure mappings, and annotations on interfaces and dynamics.

**3. Typical Use Cases**

* Find **PDB structures** for a protein target and inspect **ligand binding** or **active sites**.
* Compare **alternative structures** (different ligands, conformations, mutants, species).
* Assess **model quality** (resolution, R-factors, MolProbity/validation reports).
* Map **sequence positions** (variants, PTMs, domain boundaries) onto 3D coordinates.
* Download structures for **molecular graphics** or downstream analysis.

**4. External Connections |** Integrated with **UniProt** (sequence mapping via SIFTS), **PubChem/ChEMBL** (ligands), **NCBI/Ensembl** (gene/protein), **Reactome/KEGG** (pathways), and literature via PubMed.


# Practical

### **TP Activity 3**

**Diazepam & GABA Receptor Structures**


#### **Goal**

* **Explore** and **critically interpret bioinformatics resources** to connect diazepamâ€™s drug target(s) with its protein sequence, structure, and biological context.
* Use the following two databases:

  * [UniProt](https://www.uniprot.org)
  * [RCSB PDB](https://www.rcsb.org)


#### **How to work**

1. **Search for diazepam** in [DrugBank](https://go.drugbank.com).
2. **Open the DrugBank entry** and follow the link to the UniProt page of diazepamâ€™s molecular target.
3. In **UniProt**, explore the entry to find information about the protein sequence, function, and biological relevance. Use the worksheet as a guide.
4. From UniProt, follow the links to **RCSB PDB** to find available 3D structures of the protein, and examine how these structures help explain its function and drug interactions.

#### Evaluation

* Select **4 facts from each database** that were **surprising** or new to you.
* For each fact, briefly explain **why** it was surprising or new.
* Write your findings in a Word document and submit it in the **Tutoria** before the end of class.


#### *Hints*

* UniProt entries link directly to PDB and other databases. **Focus** on information that helps you understand how diazepam interacts with its molecular target.
* **Take your time** to understand the type of information each database provides and be critical of the info shown.
* **Ask** the tutor if you have any questions.
* **Discuss** with your colleagues how they interpret the different sources of information, and compare with your ideas.
* Keep in mind: always use your **critical thinking**.
